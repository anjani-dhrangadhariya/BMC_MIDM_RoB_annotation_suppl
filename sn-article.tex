%% Background %%
\section{Annotation Guidelines}
\label{sec:guidelines}
%
In each of the following subsections, we describe the annotation guidelines for the signalling questions using the instructional placards developed through consultation with RoB assessment and natural language processing experts.

Each placard is a flowchart encoding instructions to guide annotators in annotating the RoB question by question for the signalling questions in the Revised Cochrane RoB tool 2.0.
The flowchart starts with the title informing the annotators of which question they are annotating for.
The first diamond in the actual instructional flowchart asks the annotators to look for a specific information or part of text and if found instructs them to annotate it.
\textcolor{red}{Include a generic description about the colours, logos, shapes and flowchart elements in the placards here...}
%

%
\subsection{Signalling question: 2.3}
%
For annotation instructions for this signalling question, ``Were there deviations from the intended intervention that arose because of the trial context?'' follow the Flowchart~\ref{fig:2_3}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/2_3.jpg}
    \caption{Annotation instructions for the RoB 2.3 signalling question.}
    \label{fig:2_3}
\end{figure}

The first diamond in the flowchart asks the annotators to search for quantities of deviation with a thought bubble hinting to them that these deviations are not the dropout rate in the trial.
Deviations from the intended intervention are defined as any unintentional changes that may have occurred in the intervention being studied due to the trial context. 
For example, participants may not have complied with the study protocol, or there may have been problems with the delivery of the intervention that could have influenced the study outcomes.
Dropouts, on the other hand, refer to participants who withdrew from the study or were lost to follow-up.
Dropout rates can potentially introduce bias into a study if the characteristics of the participants who dropped out are different from those who completed the study.
High dropout rates can also affect the statistical power of the study and its ability to draw valid conclusions.
While both deviations from the intended intervention and dropout rates can potentially introduce bias into a study, they are not the same thing and should be evaluated separately when assessing the risk of bias in a study.
The diamond element also hints to the annotators that they can find this information in the text of the Results section (either within the allocation paragraph or the recruitment paragraph.)
